block reordering -> spatio-temporal optimization
Steps to run

1. make
2. ./a.out (optinal arguments){cache_line_size, cache_capacity} <inputGraphFileName> <outputFileName>

input graph file is an edge list reoredered by Gorder algorithm. Each line in edge lists indicate an edge
between 2 node indices sepearated by tab or space
GOrder algorithm can be found at:

output is a binary CSR file which contains 2 integers - <numberOfVertices> <numberOfEdges>
followed by CSR matrix (complete Vertex Array followed by complete EDge array).
For details on CSR format, look at Boost CSR webpage.
